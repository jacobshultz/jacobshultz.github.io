            The Unified Sound Tester is an application used daily on the
            production line to verify whether each unit meets acceptable volume
            standards during operation. Prior to this project, the sound-testing
            process relied on three separate applications. The goal was to
            consolidate them into a single, streamlined tool to increase
            production efficiency, extend long-term maintainability, and improve
            scalability.
          </summary>

          <!-- Context / Problem -->
          <p>
            At DeVilbiss, sound testing is a regular part of the production line
            assembly process. Each unit is checked to make sure its noise levels
            stay within set limits. The first program, built in VB6, handled
            just three oxygen concentrator models. As production expanded and
            new models came out, it didn't make sense to support the original
            sound tester application written in ancient VB6, so fancy new .NET
            apps were made to accommodate each of the new models.
          </p>
          <p>
            This solution, while working temporarily, was not without its
            issues. To begin, assemblers on the factory floor were confused with
            multiple apps. To them, a sound test is just a sound test. Why do
            they need to open a new program depending on the unit? Additionally,
            the SwEs at DeVilbiss knew that as production expanded this
            multi-app approach would become unmaintainable. The software team
            had built several programs that all do almost exactly the same
            thing. If ten new concentrator models are added to production, will
            ten new apps be created? The assemblers definitely won't like that!
            Not to mention, if something should change with how sound testing
            was performed, how long will it take to get ten (identical) changes
            implemented across all the apps? For these reasons, the SwE team at
            DeVilbiss recognized the need for a new application that could
            support sound testing for every model of oxygen concentrator on the
            line, that could "Unify" the three existing sound testers.
          </p>

          <!-- Solution -->
          <p>
            As part of my summer internship with Drive DeVilbiss, I was to build
            the Unified Sound Tester, an application which would consolidate the
            three existing sound testing applications into one unified piece of
            software. With the tool I built, testing is simple and streamlined:
            scan the unit's serial number, enter its decibel reading, and the
            app automatically routes the results to the right database all in
            one seamless flow. As of writing, it supports every existing oxygen
            concentrator model. It's designed for easy expansion, so the
            software team barely has to lift a finger to accommodate new models
            as they're released.
          </p>

          <!-- Developmet -->
          <p>
            I started by implementing the UI in a WinForms project, which was
            pretty straightforward. The real challenge came with the backend: I
            needed to design a system that could easily expand as new models
            were added. On top of that, I had to integrate my work with the
            company's existing codebase and database systems, which meant diving
            into and understanding code and tables I hadn't created. The
            database systems at DeVilbiss are complex. I had to have unique CRUD
            logic for each model. By the end of the summer I had added numerous
            contributions to the codebase to make existing modules work for my
            project. Thankfully, I wasn't alone — the software team supported me
            throughout the entire development process. They guided me from
            sketching the UI on paper to building my project's backend to
            setting up an inheritance structure for scalability and, finally,
            writing documentation and testing protocols for my software.
          </p>

          <!-- Lessons -->
          <p>
            The software team at DeVilbiss showed me what it is to be a
            professional. The engineers there are exceptional at what they do,
            they are dedicated to their work, and they are kind and generous to
            a fault. It is so rare to work with a group of people who are all
            passionate about what they do and get along with one another. Who
            are skilled enough to tackle whatever problem may come their way,
            but are humble enough to be able to admit when they are wrong.
            Working at Drive DeVilbiss gave me a great appreciation for working
            on an efficient team and was my first experience collaborating with
            others to build software. It was also a great trial-by-fire of
            working with databases and gave me some backend chops.

            The Section 4 Template Generator—or "Manual Generator" as everyone
            else calls it—is a tool I built to streamline the creation of
            owner's manuals for GapVax trucks. I used OLE automation to control
            an instance of Adobe Acrobat within Microsoft Excel, using Excel
            workbooks to handle user input and Acrobat to edit and save PDFs.
          </summary>

          <!-- Context/Problem -->
          <p>
            GapVax designs and builds highly customized vacuum trucks, and each
            one ships with a detailed owner's manual. In them section 4
            "Operation" covers how to use every piece of equipment on the truck,
            but because no two trucks are exactly alike, each truck would
            require a unique section 4 that would need to be created by hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that level of customization showcases GapVax's quality, it
            makes manual creation slow and labor-intensive; by the time I
            joined, production had scaled dramatically, and the old approach to
            Section 4 had become a serious bottleneck.
          </p>

          <!-- Solution -->
          <p>
            When using the tool I developed, the user is presented with a list
            of optional equipment features for a specific truck model. They can
            then select the desired features from the customer's order, and the
            program generates a customized 'section 4 template' of documentation
            based on those selections. While some adjustments may still be
            necessary before the final document is ready to be included with
            final manual for the truck, the tool significantly reduces the
            hand-effort by automatically assembling the relevant content
            starting points for the chosen options—essentially handling the
            tedious "gluing together" of documentation for optional equipment
            features. This is where the bloated name "Section 4 Template
            Generator" comes from.
          </p>

          <!-- Development -->
          <p>
            If you're familiar with software development you may be thinking
            that using Excel as a "pseudo-platform" is a strange, backwards
            idea. I did too. When presented with the manual creation problem I
            originally recommended building a Python app. However, leadership
            ultimately decided everything would be done in Excel. While
            definitely not typical, it actually fit their needs very cleverly:
            they needed a solution requiring almost no maintenance after I left,
            one that was easy to distribute without an installer, and something
            staff already knew how to use. Excel fit all three—simple to share,
            backwards-compatible, and familiar to non-technical users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I separated the app into multiple front ends and a singular back
            end: Each front end was a workbook dedicated to UI, it contained all
            the buttons and configuration for the listed options and contained
            no code. I made 'master copy' front end workbooks for each model of
            GapVax trucks. When a user needs to use the 'Manual Generator' for a
            MC Series unit (for example), they can simply copy the master UI
            workbook into a directory of their liking. From there, they can
            modify, duplicate, share, delete, or move the excel file without
            breaking the functionality of their copied workbook or any other
            manual generator front end workbooks. This is because the back end
            of the application (a separate, singular 'library' workbook)
            contained all the code, userforms, additional configuration, and ran
            invisibly in the background. Each front end workbook connects
            seamlessly to the singular back end workbook over the company's file
            system. The front end workbooks only have to make a singular call to
            the backend's API, which is designed to work with any front end
            workbook that follows the standard format I designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also built the app to be expanded upon without having to write
            code or edit configuration files. As I just mentioned, the backend
            can run on any frontend that is configured correctly. This way,
            should more models of trucks be added to production, all that needs
            to be done is the addition of a new frontend workbook to reflect the
            options for the new truck model (an existing frontend workbook can
            be easily duped and configured to the specifications of the new
            model). Most of the configuration is done within each unique
            instance of UI workbook in a hidden sheet. From there, users can add
            new selectable options directly in the workbook by inserting rows
            and editing columns, or by using the wizard I included.
          </p>

            The biggest challenge in this project was working within the
            constraints of Excel's scripting language, VBA. While it technically
            supports classes, it lacks core object-oriented features like
            inheritance and polymorphism, as well as modern conveniences such as
            exception handling (yes, I had to use On Error GoTo). Despite these
            limitations, I still managed to implement using the MVP pattern and
            a scalable front/back end split. This was also summer of Freshman
            year; my first time developing a project for industry. Sticking to
            software engineering principles required extensive research. In the
            end, I gained a deep appreciation for why OOP paradigms exist, along
            with valuable experience in gathering requirements, creating UIs for
            non-technical users, and designing backend systems.
