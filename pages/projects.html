            The Unified Sound Tester is an application used daily on the
            production line to verify whether each unit meets acceptable volume
            standards during operation. Prior to this project, the sound-testing
            process relied on three separate applications. The goal was to
            consolidate them into a single, streamlined tool to increase
            production efficiency, extend long-term maintainability, and improve
            scalability.
          </summary>

          <!-- Context / Problem -->
          <p>
            At DeVilbiss, sound testing is a regular part of the production line
            assembly process. Each unit is checked to make sure its noise levels
            stay within set limits. The first program, built in VB6, handled
            just three oxygen concentrator models. As production expanded and
            new models came out, it didn't make sense to support the original
            sound tester application written in ancient VB6, so fancy new .NET
            apps were made to accommodate each of the new models. This left the
            software team with several programs that all do almost exactly the
            same thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This solution, while working temporarily, was not without it's
            issues. To begin, assemblers on the factory floor were confused with
            multiple apps. To them, a sound test is just a sound test. Why do
            they need to open a new program depending on the unit? Additionally,
            the SwEs at DeVilbiss knew that as production expanded this
            multi-app approach would become unmaintainable. If ten new models
            are added to production, will ten new apps be created? The
            assemblers definitely won't like that! Not to mention, if something
            should change with how sound testing was performed, how long will it
            take to get ten (identical) changes implemented in all the apps? For
            these reasons, the SwE team at DeVilbiss recognized the need for a
            new application that could support sound testing for every model of
            oxygen concentrator on the line, that could "Unify" the three
            existing sound testers.
          </p>

          <!-- Solution -->
          <p>
            As part of my summer internship with Drive DeVilbiss, I was to build
            the Unified Sound Tester, an application which would consolidate the
            three existing sound testing applications into one unified piece of
            software. With the tool I built, testing is simple and streamlined:
            scan the unit's serial number, enter its decibel reading, and the
            app automatically routes the results to the right database — all in
            one seamless flow. As of writing, it supports every existing oxygen
            concentrator model — and it's designed for easy expansion, so the
            software team barely has to lift a finger to accommodate new models
            as they're released.
          </p>

          <!-- Developmet -->
          <p>
            I started by implementing the UI in a WinForms project, which was
            pretty straightforward. The real challenge came with the backend: I
            needed to design a system that could easily expand as new models
            were added. On top of that, I had to integrate my work with the
            company's existing codebase and database systems, which meant diving
            into and understanding code and tables I hadn't created. Thankfully,
            I wasn't alone — the software team supported me throughout the
            entire development process. They guided me from sketching the UI to
            building my project's backend to setting up an inheritance structure
            for scalability and, finally, writing documentation and testing
            protocols for my software.

          <!-- Lessons -->
          <p>
            I could write many paragraphs about the things I learned at Drive
            DeVilbiss. Software things, business things... But the most
            important thing I learned in my time there was the value of a
            high-functioning, caring team. Seriously, the SwE team at DeVilbiss
            are a group of rock-stars. They are exceptional at what they do,
            they are dedicated to their work, and (most importantly for nit-wit
            interns like myself) they are exceptionally kind and generous. It is
            so rare to work with a group of people who are all passionate about
            what they do and get along with one another. Who are skilled enough
            to tackle whatever problem may come their way, but are humble enough
            to be able to admit when they are wrong. Working on that team showed
            me what it is to be a professional. I can only hope one day I will
            get to be part of a team half as well-oiled and kind as they were!

            The Section 4 Template Generator—or "Manual Generator" as everyone
            else calls it—is a tool I built to streamline the creation of
            owner's manuals for GapVax trucks. I used OLE automation to control
            an instance of Adobe Acrobat within Microsoft Excel, using Excel
            workbooks to handle user input and Acrobat to edit and save PDFs.
          </summary>

          <!-- Context/Problem -->
          <p>
            GapVax designs and builds highly customized vacuum trucks, and each
            one ships with a detailed owner's manual. In them section
            4—Operation—covers how to use every piece of equipment on the truck,
            but because no two trucks are exactly alike, each truck would
            require a unique section 4 that would need to be created by hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that level of customization showcases GapVax's quality, it
            makes manual creation slow and labor-intensive; by the time I
            joined, production had scaled dramatically, and the old approach to
            Section 4 had become a serious bottleneck.
          </p>

          <!-- Solution -->
          <p>
            When using the tool I developed, the user is presented with a list
            of available options for a specific truck model. They can then
            select the desired features, and the program generates a customized
            'template' of documentation based on those selections. While some
            adjustments may still be necessary before the final document is
            ready to ship with the truck, the tool significantly reduces the
            hand-effort by automatically assembling the relevant content
            starting points for the chosen options—essentially handling the
            tedious "gluing together" of documentation for optional features.
            This is where the bloated name "Section 4 Template Generator" comes
            from.

            If you're familiar with software you may be thinking that using
            Excel as a "pseudo-platform" is a strange, backwards idea. I did
            too. When presented with the manual creation problem I originally
            recommended building a Python app. However leadership ultimately
            decided everything would be done in Excel. While definitely not
            typical, it actually fit their needs very cleverly: they needed a
            solution requiring almost no maintenance after I left, one that was
            easy to distribute without installers, and something staff already
            knew how to use. Excel fit all three—simple to share,
            backwards-compatible, and familiar to non-technical users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I separated the app into a front end and back end: The front end was
            just a UI workbook with all the buttons and configuration for the
            listed options and contained no code, while the back end (another
            workbook) contained all the code, userforms, additional
            configuration, and ran invisibly in the background. This setup let
            users move, delete, share, or duplicate a front end workbook without
            breaking functionality, as it connected seamlessly to the back end
            over the company's file system. I built the app to be expanded upon
            without having to write code or edit configuration files.
            Configuration is done within the actual workbook in a hidden sheet.
            From there, users can add new options directly in the workbook by
            inserting rows and editing columns. I even added a wizard for
            configuring the configuration sheet!

            The biggest challenge in this project was working within the
            constraints of Excel's scripting language, VBA. While it technically
            supports classes, it lacks core object-oriented features like
            inheritance and polymorphism, as well as modern conveniences such as
            exception handling (yes, I had to use On Error GoTo). Despite these
            limitations, I still managed to implement using the MVP pattern. It
            was also my first time developing a project for industry, so
            sticking to software engineering principles required extensive
            research. In the end, I gained a deep appreciation for why OOP
            paradigms exist, along with valuable experience in gathering
            requirements and creating UIs for non-technical users.
